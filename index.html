            <p>Over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives are financial contracts not traded on an exchange but negotiated
                directly between parties. </p>
            <p>Derivatives are financial instruments that are contracts deriving value from what they’re tied to,
                including stocks, bonds, commodities, currencies and other tradeable things such as indexes, interest
                rates—and even the weather.</p>

            <h2 class="mb-3">Types of OTC Derivatives</h2>
            <p>Investing in derivatives makes you a party to a binding agreement, and they are a flexible product that
                can be used to achieve multiple goals, but often designed to hedge against various portfolio risks or
                enhance potential yield.
            <p>
                Examples of derivatives include:
            <ul>
                <li>Forward contracts—Two sides agree in a private OTC market to buy or sell an asset at an agreed price
                    and date in the future</li>
                <li>Futures—Similar to forwards, but traded on an exchange</li>
                <li>Options—Similar again, but they give the buyer the right, although not the obligation, to buy
                    (“call”) and sell (“put”) at a predetermined price in the future. Meanwhile, the seller has the
                    obligation to fulfill the terms if the buyer exercises the option. They can be traded on an exchange
                    or OTC</li>
                <li>Swaps—A derivative contract where two parties agree to exchange cash flows based on the future
                    performance of two different financial instruments for a specified period of time</li>
            </ul>
